# hello-world
Repository for a man who is running a website for a National Wildlife Refuge Friends group.
I have enough knowledge to keep me out of serious trouble but not enough to code some of the things I want to do.  Because of my need to learn more my present coding effots take longer than I would like as I do a fair amount of "what happens if I do this" coding.
